# Python - Data Structures: Lists, Tuples

This directory contains Python exercises focused on data structures, particularly lists and tuples.

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

### General
- Why Python programming is awesome
- What are lists and how to use them
- What are the differences and similarities between strings and lists
- What are the most common methods of lists and how to use them
- How to use lists as stacks and queues
- What are list comprehensions and how to use them
- What are tuples and how to use them
- When to use tuples versus lists
- What is a sequence
- What is tuple packing
- What is sequence unpacking
- What is the del statement and how to use it

## Requirements

### Python Scripts
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Your code should use the pycodestyle (version 2.8.*)
- All your files must be executable
- The length of your files will be tested using wc

## Tasks

### 0. Print a list of integers
**File:** `0-print_list_integer.py`

Write a function that prints all integers of a list.

- Prototype: `def print_list_integer(my_list=[]):`
- Format: one integer per line
- You are not allowed to import any module
- You can assume that the list only contains integers
- You are not allowed to cast integers into strings
- You have to use `str.format()` to print integers

**Example:**
```python
#!/usr/bin/python3
print_list_integer = __import__('0-print_list_integer').print_list_integer

my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print_list_integer(my_list)
```

**Output:**
```
1
2
3
4
5
```
